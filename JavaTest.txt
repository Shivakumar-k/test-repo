Java Test
1.1 public static void main(String args[])
    
	Here public is access specifier it can be accesses from anywhere in package, static is non access specifier it is optional it loads first ,
	void is return type which means nothing to return, main is a method name inorder execute the program main method is compulsary.

1.2 class and objects
	Class is a blueprint, it as states and behaviours.
	object is super class of every class.
	
1.3 JVM, JRE, JDK
 
JVM(java virtual machine)- it is present in the form virtually
JRE(Java Runtime Environment) - loads,verifies,runs the code it creats runtime environment.
JDK(java Development kit)- it is nothing but JRE + set of libraries.

4. Constructor 
    Constructor is a special method which do not have return type.
	name of constructor should same as a class name.
	
	Types of constructor:
	parameterised constructor: it accepts parameter if we declare with constructor
	Non parameterised constructor: the constructor with no parameter is non parameterised constructor
	
5. this keyword and this()
   this keyword is used differentiate local variable with class level variable.
   this keyword is also used to point local variable
   
   this() is used to chain one constructor to other constructor within a class.
   
7. static main method:
   Static methods will load in first in jvm. static method will not create objects of method
   
   types of method:
   parameterised methods
   non parameterised methods
   
10. yes we can have private constructor but the scope will be within a class.
    yes we can overload the constructor based on the parameters it will call the constructor.
	
	class details{
	String name;
	
	    details(){
		s.o.p("without parameters")
		}
		
		details(String name){
		this.name=name;
		s.o.p("with parameters")
		}
	
		}
	
	}
